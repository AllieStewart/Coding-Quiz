Challenge 4 coursework for UT bootcamp. This challenge is to make

with each question, and then give points based on how much time was left
when the quiz finished.

## What I Have Learned
I've learned a lot about JavaScript functionality, and how useful

and do on the fly. I'm not the best at page displays though.
